To install the Red Cloud system, first make sure that
MySQL is currently installed. 

Navigate to RCAcquisition/src/build

In dbconf modify the username to match your current
MySQL install.

Run: sudo ./install

You are now able to run RCAcquisition from the command line with:
$> RCAcquisition

Where $> indicates a shell prompt, and RCAcquisition is the name
of the application.
